# Duquesne Incline Website Redesign  

This project is a **modern revision** of the official Duquesne Incline website, created for my *Spring Information Systems Milleux* course @ CMU. The redesign focuses on improving usability, visual consistency, and overall user experience while preserving the historic and cultural significance of the Incline.
